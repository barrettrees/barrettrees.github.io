Hi! I'm a graduate student in [Adam Smith's Design Research Lab](https://adamsmith.as/). People in our lab explore applications of AI to the creation and study of games (among other things). My research involves experimenting with how to search for content within and across games, exploring the psychological reality of procedural rhetoric, examining possible benefits of experiences in virtual environments, and developing a better understanding the history and potential of explorable explanations.
