# About Me

Hi! I'm a PhD student in [Adam Smith's Design Reasoning Lab](https://designreasoning.soe.ucsc.edu/). People in our lab explore applications of AI to the creation and study of games. My research involves experimenting with how to search for content within and across games, which has applications in games studies, in information retrieval, and in teaching students how to create and interpret interactive experiences. My other recent work has explored the psychological reality of procedural rhetoric, examined the influence of virtual environments, and investigated the benefits of hands-on vs digital experiences. 

Before I was a member of DRL, I was part of the [UCSC Cognitive Modeling Lab](https://cogmodlab.ucsc.edu/), the [NASA Distributed Team Decision Making Team](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/technology-onepagers/distributed-team-decision.html), and the [Stanford Psychophysiology Lab](https://spl.stanford.edu/).
