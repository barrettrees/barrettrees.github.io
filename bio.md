Hi! I'm a graduate student in [Adam Smith's Design Research Lab](https://adamsmith.as/). People in our lab explore applications of AI to the creation and study of games (among other things). My own work is building on previous research in analogy, information retrieval, user research, and game studies. I'm currently exploring new forms of search, which I hope will have applications within and beyond games.
