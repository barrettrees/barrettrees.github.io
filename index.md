Hi! I'm a PhD Candidate at UC Santa Cruz in Adam Smith's [Design Reasoning Lab](https://designreasoning.soe.ucsc.edu/). My research involves experimenting with how to search for content within and across games, which has applications in games studies, in information retrieval, and in teaching students how to create and interpret interactive experiences. 

My other recent work has explored the [psychological reality of procedural rhetoric](https://barrettrees.com/papers/Anderson%20Karzmark%20Wardrip-Fruin%202019%20The%20Psychological%20Reality%20of%20Procedural%20Rhetoric.pdf), examined the [influence of virtual environments on STEM motivation](https://barrettrees.com/papers/Starr%20Anderson%20Green%202019%20Virtual%20Reality%20Experience%20Influences%20Stereotype%20Threat%20and%20STEM%20Motivation%20Among%20Undergraduate%20Women.pdf), and contributed to understanding the benefits of [hands-on vs digital experiences](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.ucsc.edu/dist/9/365/files/2016/05/GoodmanSeymourAnderson2016.pdf). I am also interested in exploring the potential of explorable explanations, and have been inspired by the explorables community to begin creating interactive explanations presenting [my own work](http://barrettrees.com/search_by_analogy_interactive/IntroductionToSearchByAnalogy.html). 

Before I was a member of DRL, I was part of the [UCSC Cognitive Modeling Lab](https://cogmodlab.ucsc.edu/), the [NASA Distributed Team Decision Making Team](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/technology-onepagers/distributed-team-decision.html), and the [Stanford Psychophysiology Lab](https://spl.stanford.edu/).
