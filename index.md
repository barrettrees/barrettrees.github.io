Hi! I'm a researcher in human-computer interaction, interested in how the designed affordances of systems - technical and social - influence cognition and behavior. Selected projects include exploring the influence of [AI on creativity](https://barrettrees.com/papers/Homogenization_C&C2024.pdf), investigating the way games can [change how players think about the real world](https://barrettrees.com/papers/Anderson%20Karzmark%20Wardrip-Fruin%202020%20We%20Dont%20Play%20As%20We%20Think%20But%20We%20Think%20As%20We%20Play.pdf), examining the effects of [VR experiences on self-perception](https://barrettrees.com/papers/Starr%20Anderson%20Green%202019%20Virtual%20Reality%20Experience%20Influences%20Stereotype%20Threat%20and%20STEM%20Motivation%20Among%20Undergraduate%20Women.pdf), and understanding the benefits of [hands-on vs digital experiences](https://barrettrees.com/papers/Goodman%20Seymour%20Anderson%202016%20Achieving%20the%20performance%20benefits%20of%20hands-on%20experience%20when%20using%20digital%20devices%20-%20%20a%20representationla%20approach.pdf). 

For the past four years, I have been a user experience researcher at two of the largest technology companies in the world, focused on XR (AR/VR), interactive media, and improving the way insights are shared across disciplinary divides. During this time I also taught user experience research at the university level. 

Before that, I completed a PhD in Computational Media at UC Santa Cruz, exploring searching for interactive media (e.g. treating moments in a game like pages in a book) as a member of  Adam Smith's [Design Reasoning Lab](https://designreasoning.soe.ucsc.edu/). Outcomes of my work in the lab included a [series of interviews identifying user needs for videogame moment search](https://barrettrees.com/papers/Anderson%20Smith%202019%20Understanding%20User%20Needs%20in%20Videogame%20Moment%20Retrieval.pdf), the largest [corpus of interactive media for machine perception (755+ games)](https://barrettrees.com/papers/AAAI_2021_The_Undergraduate_Games_Corpus.pdf) to date, and an [explorable explanation of search-by-analogy](http://barrettrees.com/search_by_analogy_interactive/IntroductionToSearchByAnalogy.html). 

Before I was a member of Design Reasoning Lab, I was part of the [UCSC Cognitive Modeling Lab](https://cogmodlab.ucsc.edu/), the [NASA Distributed Team Decision Making Team](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/technology-onepagers/distributed-team-decision.html), and the [Stanford Psychophysiology Lab](https://spl.stanford.edu/).
