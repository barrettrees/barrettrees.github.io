Hi! I'm a games researcher and educator. As a member of Adam Smith's [Design Reasoning Lab](https://designreasoning.soe.ucsc.edu/), my research has involved experimenting with how to search for content within and across games. My videogame moment search work has applications in games studies, in information retrieval, and in teaching students how to create and interpret interactive experiences. 

I am broadly interested in the impact of games, both on players and creators. My other recent work has explored the [psychological reality of procedural rhetoric](https://barrettrees.com/papers/Anderson%20Karzmark%20Wardrip-Fruin%202019%20The%20Psychological%20Reality%20of%20Procedural%20Rhetoric.pdf), quantified the [impact of in-game actions on out of game attitudes](https://barrettrees.com/papers/Anderson%20Karzmark%20Wardrip-Fruin%202020%20We%20Dont%20Play%20As%20We%20Think%20But%20We%20Think%20As%20We%20Play.pdf), examined the [influence of virtual environments on women's STEM motivation](https://barrettrees.com/papers/Starr%20Anderson%20Green%202019%20Virtual%20Reality%20Experience%20Influences%20Stereotype%20Threat%20and%20STEM%20Motivation%20Among%20Undergraduate%20Women.pdf), and contributed to understanding the benefits of [hands-on vs digital experiences](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.ucsc.edu/dist/9/365/files/2016/05/GoodmanSeymourAnderson2016.pdf). I am also interested in exploring the potential of explorable explanations, and have been inspired by the explorables community to begin creating interactive explanations presenting [my own work](http://barrettrees.com/search_by_analogy_interactive/IntroductionToSearchByAnalogy.html). 

Before I was a member of DRL, I was part of the [UCSC Cognitive Modeling Lab](https://cogmodlab.ucsc.edu/), the [NASA Distributed Team Decision Making Team](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/technology-onepagers/distributed-team-decision.html), and the [Stanford Psychophysiology Lab](https://spl.stanford.edu/).
