Hi! I'm a games researcher and educator. As a member of Adam Smith's [Design Reasoning Lab](https://designreasoning.soe.ucsc.edu/), I have explored searching for moments within games (like pages in a book). Outcomes so far have included a [series of interviews identifying user needs for videogame moment search](https://barrettrees.com/papers/Anderson%20Smith%202019%20Understanding%20User%20Needs%20in%20Videogame%20Moment%20Retrieval.pdf), a corpus of undegraduate games (forthcoming), and several [videogame moment search tools](https://barrettrees.com/GameplayVideoExplorer/).  

I am also broadly interested in the social and psychological impact of games, both on players and creators. My other recent work has explored the [psychological reality of procedural rhetoric](https://barrettrees.com/papers/Anderson%20Karzmark%20Wardrip-Fruin%202019%20The%20Psychological%20Reality%20of%20Procedural%20Rhetoric.pdf), quantified the [impact of in-game actions on out of game attitudes](https://barrettrees.com/papers/Anderson%20Karzmark%20Wardrip-Fruin%202020%20We%20Dont%20Play%20As%20We%20Think%20But%20We%20Think%20As%20We%20Play.pdf), examined the [influence of virtual environments on women's STEM motivation](https://barrettrees.com/papers/Starr%20Anderson%20Green%202019%20Virtual%20Reality%20Experience%20Influences%20Stereotype%20Threat%20and%20STEM%20Motivation%20Among%20Undergraduate%20Women.pdf), and contributed to understanding the benefits of [hands-on vs digital experiences](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.ucsc.edu/dist/9/365/files/2016/05/GoodmanSeymourAnderson2016.pdf). I am interested in exploring the potential of explorable explanations, and have been inspired by the explorables community to begin creating interactive explanations presenting [my own work](http://barrettrees.com/search_by_analogy_interactive/IntroductionToSearchByAnalogy.html). 

Before I was a member of DRL, I was part of the [UCSC Cognitive Modeling Lab](https://cogmodlab.ucsc.edu/), the [NASA Distributed Team Decision Making Team](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/technology-onepagers/distributed-team-decision.html), and the [Stanford Psychophysiology Lab](https://spl.stanford.edu/).
